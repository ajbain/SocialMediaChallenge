# SocialMedia Project

### 24 Hour Project 

## Introduction:
The aim of this project was to test team Git Push abilities. Unfortunately for our team, we started with multiple branches on YazidLouda's page. It worked until things were force merged together. This project was started as a reboot, since Visual Studio Code wouldn't run the old project at all on any of our systems. The aim of this project is to create a social media api to visualize the different layers of keys/foreign key relationships. 

## General Info
This project uses Postman and Visual Studio Code to create a social media interface. In this instance, we are creating multiple layers of SQL relationships between posts, replies, likes, and comments. We test endpoints for the social media interface to post a post, post a comment, get a comment, etc. 

## Technologies
.Net Framework C#
Postman

## Launch 
Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.7.5 Microsoft .Net Framework Version 4.8.04084

## Examples of Use
This would be used in an environment where you are trying to look at specific users posting comments/ replies to posts.
